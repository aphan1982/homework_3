# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

<!-- //PURPOSE// -->
  This applet enables a user to randomly generate a secure, unique, and complex password. The interface and experience should be simple, clean, and optimized for multiple viewports.

<!-- //NOTES// -->
  • During the creation of the listening event for the button element, I wished to trigger a prompt that would allow a selection of one or more options--a check-box scenario--rather than the typical, binary prompt choice. A little research showed that this would be achievable via jQuery; therefore, I decided to abandon this approach in favor of the "series of prompts" mentioned in the assignment instructions.
